Database Preservation Toolkit
=============================

The Database Preservation Toolkit allows conversion between Database formats, including connection to live systems, for purposes of digitally preserve databases. The toolkit allows conversion of live or backed-up databases into preservation formats such as DBML, and XML format created for the purpose of database preservation. The toolkit also allows conversion of the preservation format into live systems to allow the full functionality of databases.
