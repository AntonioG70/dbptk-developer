{"name":"Db-preservation-toolkit","tagline":"Database Preservation Toolkit","body":"Database Preservation Toolkit\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nThe Database Preservation Toolkit allows conversion between Database formats, including connection to live systems, for purposes of digitally preserving databases. The toolkit allows conversion of live or backed-up databases into preservation formats such as **DBML** or **SIARD**, XML-based formats created for the purpose of database preservation. The toolkit also allows conversion of the preservation formats back into live systems to allow the full functionality of databases. For example, it supports a specialized export into MySQL, optimized for PhpMyAdmin, so the database can be fully  experimented using a web interface.\r\n\r\nThis toolkit was part of the [RODA project](http://www.roda-community.org) and now has been released as a project by its own due to the increasing interest on this particular feature. \r\n\r\nThe toolkit is created as a platform that uses input and output modules. Each module supports read and/or write to a particular database format or live system. New modules can easily be added by implementation of a new interface and adding of new drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Download pre-compiled version\r\n\r\nBinaries with all dependencies included:\r\n* [db-preservation-toolkit v2.0-rc2](https://github.com/keeps/db-preservation-toolkit/releases/download/2.0-rc2/db-preservation-toolkit-2.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar) (release candidate, untested, unstable)\r\n* [db-preservation-toolkit v1.0.1](https://github.com/keeps/db-preservation-toolkit/releases/download/v1.0.1/db-preservation-toolkit-1.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar)\r\n* [db-preservation-toolkit v1.0.0](http://keeps.github.io/db-preservation-toolkit/db-preservation-toolkit-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar)\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nTo use the program, open a command-line and try out the following command (replace x.y.z accordingly to the version of the binary in use):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar db-preservation-toolkit-x.y.z-jar-with-dependencies.jar \r\nSynopsys: java -jar db-preservation-toolkit.jar -i IMPORT_MODULE [options...] -o EXPORT_MODULE [options...]\r\nAvailable import modules:\r\n\tSIARD dir\r\n\tSQLServerJDBC serverName [port|instance] database username password useIntegratedSecurity encrypt\r\n\tPostgreSQLJDBC hostName [port] database username password encrypt\r\n\tMySQLJDBC hostName [port] database username password\r\n\tDB2JDBC hostname port database username password\r\n\tOracle12c hostName port database username password\r\n\tMSAccessUCanAccess database.mdb|accdb\r\n\tDBML baseDir\r\nAvailable export modules:\r\n\tSIARD dir\r\n\tSQLServerJDBC serverName [port|instance] database username password useIntegratedSecurity encrypt\r\n\tPostgreSQLJDBC [port] hostName database username password encrypt\r\n\tMySQLJDBC hostName [port] database username password\r\n\tDB2JDBC hostname port database username password\r\n\tPhpMyAdmin hostName [port] database username password\r\n\tDBML baseDir\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have to select an input and an output module, providing for each its configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to connect to a live MySQL database and export its content to DBML format, you can use the following command.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar db-preservation-toolkit-x.y.z-jar-with-dependencies.jar \\\r\n-i MySQLJDBC localhost example_db username p4ssw0rd \\\r\n-o SIARD example_db_siard_export\r\n```\r\n## How to build from source\r\n\r\n1.

Check your database configuration if it accepts TCP/IP connection and if your IP address is allowed to connect. Also, ensure that the user has permissions to access the database from your IP address.\r\n\r\n**Problems importing from Microsoft Access**\r\n\r\nTo import from Microsoft Access you need to be on a Windows machine with Microsoft Access installed. This is because the current Microsoft Access import module is implemented using ODBC connection. Therefore, you need Windows installed to be able to use ODBC. Also, you need Microsoft Access installed so its ODBC driver is installed on your system.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in order to extract DB structures we need to have access to the internal database table `Msysrelationships`. You need to perform some hacking over the DBMS and this is version dependent. Please follow the instructions described on Microsoft's white paper, which explains how to do this for all Microsoft Access versions: [\"Preparing a Microsoft Access Database for Migration\"](http://rawgithub.com/keeps/db-preservation-toolkit/master/doc/Preparing_MSAccess_for_Migration.pdf).\r\n\r\n**Got error \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\"**\r\n\r\nThe toolkit might need more memory than it is available by default (normally 64MB). To increase the available memory use the `-Xmx` option. For example, the following command will increase the heap size to 3 GB.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -Xmx3g -jar db-preservation-toolkit-x.y.z-jar-with-dependencies.jar ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe toolkit needs enough memory to put the table structure definition in memory (not the data) and to load each data row or row set, which might include having some BLOBs completely in memory, but this depends on the database driver implementation.\r\n\r\n**Main hard drive gets full due to temporary files**\r\n\r\nDue to the structure of some export modules (e.g. SIARD) and because we only want to pass throught the database once with minimum amount of used memory, all BLOBs and CLOBs of a database table must be kept on temporary files during the export of a table. This can cause your main disk to get full and the execution to fail. To select a diferent folder for the temporary files, e.g. on a bigger hard drive, use the option `-Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/tmpdir`. For example, the following command will use the folder `/media/BIGHD/tmp` as the temporary folder:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -Djava.io.tmpdir=/media/BIGHD/tmp -jar db-preservation-toolkit-x.y.z-jar-with-dependencies.jar ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Information & Commercial support\r\n\r\nFor more information or commercial support, contact [KEEP SOLUTIONS](http://www.keep.pt/contactos/?lang=en).\r\n\r\n<!-- Removing build status as some database library drivers cannot be distributed via maven\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keeps/db-preservation-toolkit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keeps/db-preservation-toolkit)\r\n-->\r\n","google":"UA-42276300-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
